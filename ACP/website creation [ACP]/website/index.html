      <p class="c3">The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and 
        the objects that orbit it. It was formed about 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun and a protoplanetary disc. 
        The Sun is a typical star that maintains a balanced equilibrium by the fusion of hydrogen into helium at its core, releasing this energy from its outer photosphere. 
        Astronomers classify it as a G-type main-sequence star.</p>

        <h1>Big Bang Theory</h1>
        <p>The Big Bang Theory is the leading explanation for how the universe began. Simply put, it says the universe as we know it started with an infinitely hot and dense single point that inflated and stretched — first at unimaginable speeds, and then at a more measurable rate — over the next 13.7 billion years to the still-expanding cosmos that we know today.</p>
        
        <h1>Did You Know?</h1>
        <p>1]The highest mountain known is on an asteroid: Vesta has a mountain that is 22 km high, three times taller than Mount Everest<br>
            2]Space junk is a growing problem: There are about 500,000 pieces of space junk orbiting Earth, including fragments from rockets and satellites
            <br>
            3]The temperature in the void of space is about -270.45°C: This is just slightly above absolute zero
